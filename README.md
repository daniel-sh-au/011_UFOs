# Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
To provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, the webpage will be modified to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filter, the table will also allow filtering for the city, state, country, and shape columns. 

### Resources
* Visual Studio Code, Javascript, HTML
* Bootstrap CSS Library
* Data Source: [data.js](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module011_UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
* Challenge Code: [app.js](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module011_UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js), [index.html](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module011_UFOs/blob/main/index.html)

## Results
The steps for using the search criteria of the UFO webpage are listed below: 
1. Upon entering the webpage, locate the Filter Search area of the webpage (See the below image in the red box). Observe that each filter has a corresponding input box.

2. In the corresponding input box, type in the date, city, state, country, or/and shape to be filtered. Once entered, press the *enter* key on the keyboard to show the results or *left-click* outside the current input box. Note that multiple filters can be used to filter out UFO sightings. Three different filters are shown in the image below, each indicated by a different colour.
