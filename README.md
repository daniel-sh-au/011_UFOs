# Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
To provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, the webpage will be modified to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filter, the table will also allow filtering for the city, state, country, and shape columns. 

### Resources
* Visual Studio Code, Javascript, HTML
* Bootstrap CSS Library
* Data Source: [data.js](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module011_UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
* Challenge Code: [app.js](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module011_UFOs/blob/main/static/js/app.js), [index.html](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module011_UFOs/blob/main/index.html)

## Results
 Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary
